Manual solving Schrodinger equation using the Numerov method for a quantum spring (aka quantum harmonic oscillator)

This is didactic sample on how to solve Schrodinger equation using the Numerov method for a quantum harmonic oscillator. Essentially about a couple hundred lines of code to see a quantum spring go back and forth.
